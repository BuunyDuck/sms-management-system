Lost Email

Check your junk, spam or trash email folders first.  Is the sender whitelisted in your Spamfilter?

The only way to trace undelivered email is to get a copy of the header of bounce or returned message your sender gets back when they try to send to you.

You can send us the full text when you get that and we can trace by sender, IP address, mail servers and block lists.

If the sender is on a block list, they will have to get themselves removed from it.  If they are on a spam friendly or hacker friendly service, they might consider switching to a reputable host.  

If you need to whitelist or block senders you can do that by logging into:

with your email address and email password.
