Fiber Diagnosis / Indicator Lights

The exact LED layout can vary slightly by model, but the fiber-related LEDs are generally the same across the UISP ONT lineup:

PON (Passive Optical Network)--Shows successful registration with the OLT.

Solid green --> Registered and active.

Blinking green --> Attempting to register.

Red or off --> No signal, or registration failed.

LOS (Loss of Signal) --> Indicates the fiber physical status.

Off --> No loss, fiber link detected.

Solid red --> No light or optical signal present.

Blinking red --> Optical power too low or unstable.

Some ONTs merge PON and LOS into a single "Fiber" LED, with green = good and red = bad.

Other LEDs (LAN, Wi-Fi, Power) vary by model but don't affect fiber diagnosis.
