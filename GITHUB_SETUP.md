# GitHub Setup Instructions

## After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/mooseman/Desktop/www/sms-management-system

# Add your GitHub repo as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sms-management-system.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Verify it worked:
```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sms-management-system.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sms-management-system.git (push)
```

## 🎯 Future Workflow:

### On Your Mac (Development):
```bash
# Make changes to files
# Test locally

# When ready to save/deploy:
git add -A
git commit -m "Added contact search feature"
git push origin main
```

### On Production Server:
```bash
cd /path/to/sms-management-system

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Clear Laravel cache
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
```

## 🔒 Security Note:

Your `.env` file is **NOT** pushed to GitHub (it's in `.gitignore`). This is correct!

**On production server**, you'll need to:
1. Create a new `.env` file
2. Copy from `.env.example`
3. Set production values for:
   - `APP_URL`
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_DATABASE`, etc.
   - `TWILIO_*` credentials
