# 📱 Phase 1: SMS Send/Receive Testing (No Database)

## ✅ What's Been Built

### Services
- `app/Services/TwilioService.php` - Complete Twilio integration
  - Send SMS
  - Parse incoming webhooks
  - Validate signatures
  - Format phone numbers

### Controllers
- `app/Http/Controllers/API/SmsController.php` - Send SMS
- `app/Http/Controllers/API/WebhookController.php` - Receive SMS

### Routes
- `POST /api/sms/send` - Send custom SMS
- `POST /api/sms/send-test` - Send test message
- `GET /api/sms/test-connection` - Test Twilio credentials
- `POST /webhook/twilio` - Receive incoming SMS (Twilio webhook)
- `POST /webhook/twilio/status` - Delivery status updates

### UI
- `/send` - Beautiful test interface with 3 sections:
  1. Test Twilio connection
  2. Send test SMS
  3. Send custom SMS

---

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Add Twilio Credentials to .env

```bash
cd /Users/mooseman/Desktop/www/sms-management-system
nano .env
```

Add these lines (replace with your actual credentials):

```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+14062152048
TWILIO_VALIDATE_SIGNATURE=false
```

**Where to get credentials:**
https://console.twilio.com

### 2. Make Sure Server is Running

```bash
php artisan serve --port=8001
```

Server should be running on: **http://localhost:8001**

---

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Web Interface

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:8001/send
2. **Click "Test Connection"** - Should show your Twilio account info
3. **Enter your phone number** and click "Send Test SMS"
4. **Check your phone** - You should receive a message!

### Test 2: API Directly (Terminal)

```bash
# Test connection
curl http://localhost:8001/api/sms/test-connection

# Send test SMS
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/sms/send-test \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d "to=+14065551234"

# Send custom SMS
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/sms/send \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d "to=+14065551234" \
  -d "body=Hello from Laravel!"
```

### Test 3: Watch Logs (Real-time)

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/mooseman/Desktop/www/sms-management-system
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

You'll see logs like:

```
[2025-10-16 11:30:00] local.INFO: SMS Sent Successfully
{
  "to": "+14065551234",
  "from": "+14062152048",
  "message_sid": "SMxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

---

## 📨 Testing Incoming SMS (Webhook)

### Option 1: Using ngrok (Recommended)

```bash
# Install ngrok if needed
brew install ngrok

# Start ngrok
ngrok http 8001
```

You'll get a URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

**Configure in Twilio Console:**
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming
2. Click your phone number (+14062152048)
3. Under "Messaging Configuration" → "A MESSAGE COMES IN"
4. Set to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/twilio`
5. Save

**Test it:**
1. Send an SMS to +14062152048 from your phone
2. Watch your terminal - you'll see:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
📱 NEW SMS RECEIVED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
From: +14065551234
To: +14062152048
Message: Test from my phone
Time: 2025-10-16 11:35:00
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Option 2: Simulate Webhook (Testing)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/webhook/twilio \
  -d "From=+14065551234" \
  -d "To=+14062152048" \
  -d "Body=Test message" \
  -d "MessageSid=SM1234567890"
```

## 📊 What You'll See

### Outbound SMS (You send):
- ✅ Shows in browser UI with success message
- ✅ Logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- ✅ Customer receives SMS on their phone
- ✅ Status updates come back via webhook

### Inbound SMS (Customer replies):
- ✅ Appears in terminal logs (colorful box)
- ✅ Logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- ✅ Webhook processes successfully

**What's NOT happening yet:**
- ❌ No database storage
- ❌ No customer linking
- ❌ No chatbot responses
- ❌ No email notifications
- ❌ No conversation history

**This is Phase 1: Just proving the pipes work!** ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Twilio credentials not configured"

Check your `.env` file has:
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxx
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+14062152048
```

Then restart the server:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
php artisan config:clear
php artisan serve --port=8001
```

### Error: "Invalid phone number format"

Phone must be in E.164 format:
- ✅ Good: `+14065551234`
- ❌ Bad: `406-555-1234`, `(406) 555-1234`, `4065551234`

### Webhook not receiving messages

1. Check ngrok is running: `curl http://localhost:4040/status`
2. Verify Twilio webhook URL is set correctly
3. Check Twilio console for webhook errors
4. Make sure your Laravel server is running

### Can't see logs

```bash
# Make sure log file exists and is writable
touch storage/logs/laravel.log
chmod 644 storage/logs/laravel.log

# View last 50 lines
tail -50 storage/logs/laravel.log

# Watch in real-time
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know Phase 1 is working when:

1. ✅ Test connection shows your Twilio account info
2. ✅ You receive test SMS on your phone
3. ✅ Logs show "SMS Sent Successfully"
4. ✅ You can send custom messages
5. ✅ Incoming SMS appears in logs (with ngrok)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Once Phase 1 works, we'll add:

1. **Database Migration** - Store messages permanently
2. **SmsMessage Model** - Eloquent model with relationships
3. **Save on Send** - Log every outbound message
4. **Save on Receive** - Log every inbound message
5. **Conversation View** - See message history

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

Then you'll have:
- ✅ Persistent message history
- ✅ Search/filter messages
- ✅ Customer conversation threads
- ✅ Foundation for chatbot & tickets
